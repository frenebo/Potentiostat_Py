# Potentiostat_Py
This is a Python library made by Paul Kreymborg made for the Atkinson Lab to help interface with the [Pansodtee et al. Potentiostat](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257167) and use it to run chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry experiments. Most of the code that interfaces with the various chips is based on code by Pansodtee et al.
